## Overview

This is the **second** project for the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis online free class. This file is an addendum to the project so that you may perform the peer assessment in an easier fashion. I hope you enjoy the peer assessments as much as I do. Thank you for taking the time to look at my little projects. 

P.S. I have tried to include all pertinent information so that you can replicate this project...should you want to do that. I highly recommend the Coursera courses :)
