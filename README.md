Peer Assessment 2 for Exploratory Data Analysis

This is the second project for the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis online free class. I have provided the following items for this project on this github.

1. Instructions.md is the file with all instructions for this repository
2. Answers.Rmd (html, pdf, and word formats available). This file contains all the answers and plots to the questions for the Peer Assessment #2. 
3. Individual plot scripts and .png files are in the respository for this assessment.


Thank you for taking the time to do the peer review. Have a wonderful day!
